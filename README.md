# Next Word Prediction using LSTM

##  Project Overview
This project implements a simple **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model to estimate the next word in a sequence. It is built using **Python and Keras** for natural language processing tasks.

###  Dataset
The dataset consists of the **first three pages** of *"A Game of Thrones: Book One of A Song of Ice and Fire"* by George R. R. Martin, used in plain text format.

##  Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, sequences)
- Building and training LSTM model
- Predicting the next word based on input sequence
